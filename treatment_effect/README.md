# Effect of Treatments on leaves of species
  **First project with used for analysis of post grad experiment data.**

## 1. `treatment_effect.R`
  This is the script file created for the analysis of data.

### 2. `species_treatment_data.csv`
  The data is result of experiment conducted on leaves for testing capability of rooting through leaves.
The .csv file contains species (`Species`) used for trails in experiment and the result of using 4 treatments 
i.e., "Control - no treatment", "Coconut water - 10% solution", "IBA (Indole-butyric-acid 1000ppm", and "Coconut water and IBA 1000ppm" (`Treatment`).
The following parameters were taken after 60 days after setting of experiment `num_roots_n` - number of roots generated,
`lng_long_root_cm` - length of longest root in centimeters and `dia_long_root_mm` - daiameter of longest root in millimeters.

## 3. plots
  Folder contains the visualisations generated by the code for communication of results.
